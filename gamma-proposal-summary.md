# Gap Analysis Automation Platform
## Executive Summary Proposal

**Veteran Vectors**
*6-Month Engagement | Unclassified through TS/SCI*

---

## The Opportunity

Your current gap analysis system relies on Microsoft Excel, Power Automate, and manual processes. It works — but it's fragile, dependent on one person, and cannot deploy to classified networks.

We propose replacing it with a modern, containerized automation platform that:
- Eliminates Excel fragility
- Automates report generation
- Deploys to Secret and TS/SCI networks via Game Warden
- Transfers ownership to you with no ongoing vendor dependency

---

## What We Deliver

**A complete, turnkey system** — not a SaaS subscription.

You receive working software, all source code, documentation, and training at each milestone. You own everything. You can operate it independently or engage us for ongoing support.

**Five automated workflows:**
1. Survey distribution with automatic reminders
2. Response collection and validation
3. Data analysis (scoring, trends, factor analysis)
4. Automated report generation
5. Survey lifecycle management

**Three deployment tiers:**
- Unclassified (commercial cloud)
- Secret (SIPRNet via Game Warden)
- TS/SCI (JWICS via Game Warden)

---

## Why Game Warden

Traditional government system certification (ATO) costs $200K-$500K and takes 6-18 months.

Game Warden is a DoD-accredited platform that lets applications **inherit** the certification. Your system deploys on their platform and is authorized in weeks, not months.

This is how we get to classified networks in 6 months instead of 2 years.

---

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **Black MVP** | Months 1-2 | Working system on unclassified, tested at March event |
| **Yellow** | Months 2-4 | Operational on Secret (SIPRNet) |
| **Red** | Months 4-6 | Operational on TS/SCI (JWICS) |

Single contract with milestone gates. You approve each phase before proceeding.

## Investment

### Year 1 Total: $257K - $451K

| Category | Cost |
|---|---|
| Platform development | $73K - $133K |
| Cloud infrastructure | $117K - $250K |
| Veteran Vectors fee | $60K |
| Ongoing support (10 months) | $7.5K |

**Where the money goes:**
- ~30% builds the system
- ~50% runs the infrastructure (mostly Game Warden platform fees for classified)
- ~20% is Veteran Vectors engineering and support

The infrastructure cost seems high, but it **replaces a $200K-$500K standalone ATO**. Game Warden is the shortcut to classified deployment.

---

## Payment Structure

Payments align with milestones — you pay as we deliver.

| Milestone | Trigger | Approximate Payment |
|---|---|---|
| Contract signed | Kick-off | $33K - $45K |
| Black MVP accepted | March event | $37K - $55K |
| Yellow operational | SIPRNet live | $42K - $72K |
| Red operational | JWICS live | $51K - $81K |
| Monthly retainer | Month 3 onward | $750/month |

---

## What You Get at Each Gate

Every milestone delivers a complete, working system:

- Operational software deployed and tested
- All source code and configuration files
- Infrastructure-as-code for reproducible deployments
- Operator documentation and runbooks
- Training for your team

You can stop at any milestone with a fully functional system at that classification level.

---

## Ongoing Support

**$750/month** starting Month 3 (15% of our $60K fee)

What it covers:
- Security patch monitoring and container updates
- Incident response and troubleshooting
- Workflow modifications as your needs evolve
- Quarterly architecture reviews
- Compliance updates as standards change

This is optional after the initial engagement — you'll have everything needed to self-operate.

---

## Government-Ready

The system is built for eventual sale to a government end user:

- Full intellectual property rights transfer
- Software bill of materials (SBOM) at each milestone
- Section 508 accessibility compliance
- CMMC / NIST 800-171 compliance documentation
- Game Warden ATO inheritance — no standalone certification needed

You handle the government contracting relationship. We build a product that's ready for it.

---

## Risk Management

| Risk | How We Address It |
|---|---|
| Delays getting on Game Warden | Start onboarding in Month 1, not when we need it |
| Can't test on classified networks | Your cleared personnel run our test scripts; we support from unclassified |
| Security vulnerabilities discovered | Budget includes remediation; retainer covers ongoing patching |
| Scope changes mid-project | Milestone gates define "done" — changes route through retainer |

---

## Why Veteran Vectors

- TS/SCI cleared operator leading the engagement
- Experience with Game Warden deployment pipeline
- Open-source stack with no vendor lock-in
- You own everything — code, containers, documentation
- Fixed fee with milestone payments — no surprise costs

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** this proposal
2. **Sign** single 6-month engagement
3. **Kick off** — we need access to your current Power Automate flows, Excel data, and Power BI dashboards
4. **March event** — live user acceptance testing of Black MVP
5. **Month 6** — full TS/SCI deployment operational
